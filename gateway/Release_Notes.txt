====================V1.2.0064_Release_r208====================
Update note:
LoRa network is divided into three working modes: Packet forwarder / Basic station / Network Server.
LoRa Network Server: Support Class B mode in Region : CN470/US915/EU868/IN865/KR920/AS923 (Only for WisGate Edge Prime/Max).
LoRa Network Server: Support Class B/C Multicast in Region CN470/US915/EU868/IN865/KR920/AS923.
LoRa Network Server: Support AWS-IoT integration (Global Integration).

Network: Support Ethernet port mode selection (LAN or WAN).

Known issues:
Class B / Multicast not support  in Region AU915 (Beacon format error).
Before the system time is synchronized with the network, the Class B mode cannot work.If the user uses external NS, the external NS needs to have a time calibration mechanism, otherwise the time deviation will affect the use of class B.
When the device is reconfigured or restarted, the multicast group downlink frame counter will be reset. Restart node and gateway at the same time.
