Chirpstack vs AWS

Point to note: Actual setup process for gateway & sensors is very similar on both platforms. We have implemented and tested on both.

Pros of Chirpstack

'Free'
Managed in house, so complete control/retention of data
Runs on HPC infrastructure where people have other applications which makes integration easier
Simple data management with Postgres database or other endpoints
If the Glensaugh hub is set up we can offer it as a free service to clients
Can forward traffic on to AWS or other services if necessary


Cons

Potential uptime risk during maintenance
Needs some buy-in from ITS to ensure smooth integration with existing Hutton IT systems



Pros of AWS

Proven technology
Certificates/tls stuff may be easier to implement there - right now we're sending plain text (encoded not encrypted) but web portal is secure (https)


Cons of AWS

Not free; cost according to data volume
Possible privacy concerns - particularly in terms of the location of data (server hosted in Ireland) and potential DPA/GDPR issues with Brexit
